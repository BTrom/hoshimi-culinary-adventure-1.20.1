## Errors:
- [ ] Pineapple still has the wrong item icon
- [ ] Crab traps still missing the sprite for the empty slot
- [ ] Cachalot fighting giant squid works almost no time (not completely)
- [ ] Hummingbirds do absolutely nothing at all
- [ ] Shibas become very slow when tamed
- [ ] Green onion seeds don't have a sprite or translation key
- [ ] Wild tea bushes are gray, as they don't properly get the foliage color, and they still have collision boxes
- [ ] Chicken nests don't work, but they can hold eggs
 
## Missing:
- [ ] Avocado seeds exist, but they're supposed to act as a sapling that isn't added yet

## Details:
- [ ] Pickles have a bigger sprite than cucumbers, which isn't very fitting
- [ ] Olives don't have a source
- [ ] Pomegranates don't have a source
- [ ] Limes don't have a source
- [ ] "Dragon Bush" (dragon_bush) should be named "Wild Dragon Fruits"
- [ ] Remember to add "Paprika" from red peppers
- [ ] Let's remove the white dots on several of the crabs' eyes. They make them look _derpy_...
- [ ] Basins for crushing will appear filled after the first crushing, but they still require repeating the process 3 more times to retrieve the result, which can be confusing. Maybe try to give it the respective states in the block model
- [ ] Current lobster and cooked lobster sprites have white eyes, which looks weird. Same applies for their models
- [ ] Oat pancakes are redundant over normal and chocolate pancakes
- [ ] Pet bowls don't work, probably because I removed the naming
- [ ] Feeding troughs don't work. Animals don't use them and they won't let you add food to them

## AI:
- [ ] Don't know if it's intended, but Tiger Prawns swim up by small hops and then drop down like a rock
- [ ] Urchins turn around, like any mob, and don't inflict poison upon touching them
- [ ] Lobsters don't fight back
- [ ] Crows can't be tamed (won't pick the necessary items from the ground) and won't attack crops. They seem to work fine if tamed
